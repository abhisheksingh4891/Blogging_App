**ABSTRACT**

Real time chat application named “CHAT-ROOM” is a 21st Century is the age of technology and social media with the increase in social media the amount of applications have tremendously increased with the last decade with the increase of online access and cheap internet life has become more simpler to get things just by using one-click and accessing the functionality of the application. But with the increased risk of data leak and application hacking the security and privacy has been the primal factor for the user for the past few years. 
So with this current motive we are making a chat application using socket programming.

**INTRODUCTION**

CHAT-ROOM is a social-networking tool that leverages on technology advancement thereby allowing its users communicate and share media. It offers a wonderful one stop shop experience for keeping in touch with people you know. It can be used for messaging, placing voice messages, making voice and video calls, share updates and photos, share locations, enhance local socializing in pidgin English, play games and make monetary financial transactions. 

**BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION**

CHATY has the potential to become a widely used socializing app in Africa with specific focus on the West African sub region with a grass root pilot scheme take off in Nigeria due to the continent rich multi ethnic culture and a wide range of her special way of communication called pidgin English in Nigeria. The numerical strength of the Nigerian population which is estimated to be above 200million people presently affords a viable economic space as a rallying point for this application. With the gradual acceptance of adult literacy gaining roots in Africa and the various government policies to drive education to the grass roots, CHATY will be a welcome development and very user friendly to the average Nigerian citizen among which includes the local peasant farmers, market women, artisans, the low-income earners, less privilege and the lower social stratification individuals who are numerous in population. The introduction of the Pidgin English feature is a primary drive and force of attraction as it helps break the rank of the academic division between those who claim the Queens English is the best, thereby creating fun and increased cross fertilization of ideas, with a resultant economic boost.
While emphasis must be made to fore runners of similar inventions, which cuts across technology divides, it must be well understood that the basic fundamental of the CHATY which is embedded in messaging service, evolve as an app where you can comfortably make financial transactions as well.

So we made this for people free of cost and made this project with people’s demands.

**Functionality of a Chat App :-**

As mentioned above, the implementation and functionality of those components will vary depending on the app’s intended use. So, let’s cover the core features of a chat app before diving into the deep end of functionality..

User Registration and Authentication: If you want users, you have to give people a way to use your chat app. Pretty straightforward. The most common way to register and authenticate users is with their email or phone number. 

Individual and group messaging: The core feature of a chat app is the ability to send and receive messages. Both individual (peer to peer) messaging and group messaging are essential aspects of a good chat app.

Push notifications: You don’t want your users to have to open your app every few minutes to check for new messages. That would create a terrible user experience, especially on mobile. Push notifications to notify users of a new incoming message or reaction have become a must-have feature.

Sharing of media files: Gone are the days of plain text messages. Gifs, emojis, audio, images and video files are the new standard. So your app will need local media storage along with cloud storage for fast retrieval.

User settings & profile customization: Customization lets your users express their individuality and creativity. Whether it’s the ability to change their font, background color, nickname or something else—it’s important to allow users some flexibility to personalize their experience.
